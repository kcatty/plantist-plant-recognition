# plantist-plant-recognition
It's the project created during my studies for my Bachelor Thesis in Lodz University of Technology in 2023.
The scope of the project was to create a web application to recognize and identify plant species.

## Technology Stack
Python, Flask, React

## Models
To train the models there was used the Swedish Leaf Dataset - https://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/en/research/datasets/swedish-leaf/

There were 3 models created VGG16,Xception and Custom - all of them with and without data augmentation.
